#Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state.
The dataset includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California.
Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).
Block groups can also be called "districts" for short.

In the scope of this project the model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all other metrics.
